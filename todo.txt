Implement payment model:
    A button on the left side of the canvas that the player can click. It will open a menu over the canvas, where the player can select what item to buy.
    Items to buy: Probably a flex container of different attributes, like big head, big arm, big leg.

React components- need 5 of them.

Implement middleware status codes working.

Delete request account when refreshing so it doesn't log back in?

Make canvas only react to inputs when it is the focus. When typing changePasword it'll affect it. Or, implement pause feature. probably not necessary unless I want to display components on top of canvas.

Fix weird canvas centering. It is slightly too big due to border. It is 16 px too wide on the right.

DONE Implement change password:
    Changing password will require user to enter their username, password, and new password. It'll send code to the server to update that. That'll use some bcrypt nuances...
    Check on client if the two passwords are different.
    Use same kind of function as updateItems in Account controller.

Turn into cloud and fly offscreen like in Bob's game.

GOOD Improve styling of log in button (formSubmit)
    Make sure it uses no code from Domo-change colors, and borders if I want to.

DONE Fix item saving.
    It is not actually saving on the server. The .save() function doesn't actually save to the mongoDB.
